<p>13 Oct 2008, Carrsville, KY

<p>No entry yesterday because I took a rest day in Henderson, KY (Downtown
Diner&mdash;<u>great pancakes</u>). It was kinda weird, because there were some
time during the day that I felt I had nothing to do. It's not that bike touring
is typically rushed or hectic, it's just that there's always <u>something</u>
worth doing&mdash;if it's light out, I can be riding, and otherwise I can be
sleeping (so I can get riding first thing in the AM). So farting around
Henderson just made me feel uneasy, in a kind of lethargic way. Then today, as
I started out again, it felt weird to be riding again. I just wasn't as
comfortable. It also didn't hep that despite riding on flat ground all morning
I was going slowly b/c of high winds which were more to my side, but headwinds
nonetheless.

<p>I had lunch at Pizza Hut because it was the only restaurant open in the
little town I stopped in (Sturgis, KY). That didn't help b/c I find Pizza Hut
fakey even by chain fast food standards. I called my mom, and she even said I
sounded tired.

<p>After lunch things picked up, though. I hit some hills which both blocked
the wind and gave me a feeling of accomplishment for my efforts (when riding
into a headwind you don't get to look forward to a downhill cruise like you do
on a hill).

<p>Running low on water, and worried about being in the middle of nowhere, I
asked some folks if I could fill up from their spigot. They invited me into the
kitchen (stepping over their two daughters' dolls and toys&mdash;and the
daughters themselves) so I could fill up at their sink.

<p>I was again worried about finding a camping spot as I rode into Carrsville,
KY. I rode past their new community center, and was eyeing the large back yard
& pavilion. I asked some folks about camping there, and they redirected me to
another man who was busy power washing his house. Before I could get my whole
sentence out he offered to let me camp behind the community center. He also
offered to let me use the restroom in the building.

<p>As I was setting up, another guy rolled up in his truck, and started showing
me how to turn the lights and fans in the pavilion on and off. One of them
remarked to the other, "Hey, we've got a tourist!" or something just the same.

<p>To top it off, I was fed dinner&mdash;spaghetti with meat sauce & buttered
bread with sweet tea. Then, as I was writing this entry, another man & his
grandson came by. He offered me a bed, which I politely refused, and proceeded
to sit at the picnic table & talk with me for probably 10 or 20 minutes. He
kind of wandered through many subjects, times & locations in KY & IL, but was a
very kind man & offered me breakfast if I came over in the morning.
