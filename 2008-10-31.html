<p>31 Oct 2008, Somerville Lake, TX

<p>Happy Halloween!

<p>I chatted w/ two friendly guys at Sam Houston N.F. as I left this
morning&mdash;Steve &amp; Bud if I recall correctly. They told me about another
cyclist they'd run into around there who had hit a rough spot in his
Alaska-to-Florida tour. he'd had lots of equipment stolen &amp; bike troubles.
Made me thankful I've been fortunate so far on both those fronts&mdash;and made
me more careful about locking my bike today at lunch &amp; at the library.

<p>I'm camping on Somer villa Lake at an Army C.O.E. campground (Yegua Park). I
tried an MRE for dinner&mdash;it was pretty bad, so I think I might leave the
other two here as a gift to the next camper&mdash;Lord knows they won't go bad.

<p>This looks like a pretty spot, but I rolled in right at dark, so I can't
really tell. So far I'm just annoyed by all the little burrs that are sticking
to my feet. Hopefully they're more visible in the AM, so I can avoid them. I
also need to pluck them out of my tires, so I can hopefully avoid more flats.

<p>Anyway, it's Bible time, then shower time, then bed time&mdash;under the
stars (w/no rainfly) tonight.
