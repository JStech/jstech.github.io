<p>3 Nov 2008, Austin, TX

<p>Rest day in Austin today. Of course, I still had to explore the city on my
bike. It's like a smaller version of Washington DC, but with a strong college
feel because of UT. There are tons of cyclists too, so drivers are attentive to
cyclists. One thing I noticed was that there is a strong blinky light culture
among the cyclists, which I have to assume is related to the advocacy &amp;
education efforts in the city &amp; at UT. More ideas for Baltimore . . .
