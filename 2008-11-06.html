<p>6 Nov 2008, Vanderpool, TX

<p>I'm stealth camping again tonight, but I'm in a much more discreet
location&mdash;alongside the road but down an embankment &amp; behind trees.

<p>I had my latest day riding so far (relative to the sunset, at least). The
state park I'd planned to stay at (Lost Maples) fell through&mdash;their
hook-up campsites were full, and the primitive sites were not bike
accessible&mdash;you had to hike to them. Of course, I was arriving at the park
right at nightfall, after taking longer to ride my planned distance today than
expected (and wasting too much time in Kerrville), so I set out again in the
dark with my headlamp on my helmet. After I passed on a few weak options, I
spotted trees along the road &amp; a strip of grass heading off behind them.
It's a pretty nice spot.

<p>So I don't know how late I actually stopped, but it was probably an hour
after sunset. The waxing moon is very bright, though, so that helps.

<p>Notes on food: couscous and foil-packaged meat is a great, simple, filling
meal. Whataburger is the TX version of Wendy's.
