<p>1 Dec 2008, Palo Verde, CA

<p>Very good day today. I traded contact info with the other cyclists before
heading out. My rear tire felt low as I started, and I debated changing it or
just filling it up. I was impatient, so I filled it &amp; headed out, expecting
&amp; dreading that it would be flat in the first half hour. Thankfully, it
lasted all day!

<p>I had lunch in Quartzsite, AZ, which is basically one giant, temporary flea
market. The town has 157 RV parks, and the street was basically lined with
outdoor vendors.

<p>Jumping back before lunch, I saw some folks flying ultralights as I passed
by an RV park. I stopped to look &amp; take some photos &amp; ask a bunch of
question. There were also some RC planes in the air some distance across the
road. Pretty cool. The RV park had a helipad too . . .

<p>Crossed the Colorado River into California after lunch. Last state! I
stopped for a cold drink at Starbucks &amp; a guy with an Ohio State hat
started asking me about my trip. We chatted for a bit before he took off again.

<p>I'm camping at the Tamarisk RV park in Palo Verde, CA. It's a very laid-back
establishment in a very laid-back town. I haven't seen anyone who works here
&amp; the office closed at 1pm. I'm told that tent camping is free, though.

<p>As I finished dinner one of the residents, Danny, came &amp; started making
a fire in the fire pit. He was really friendly &amp; gave me some insight into
the town&mdash;very small, laid back, everyone-knows-everyone, etc. He's gone
off now, but I'm still enjoying the fire. It's mesmerizing.
