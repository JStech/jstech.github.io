The internet doesn't seem to have these lyrics, and it's a great shame.

### Raise the Class - Dayna Kurtz
> I think this Jesus sounds like a great man,  
> He's humble and grateful and kind as he can.  
> That hatred and violence births hatred again.  
> I think this Jesus sounds like a great man.  
>
> But what if the rapture's entirely manmade?  
> What if it's coming and no-one gets saved?  
> At least three of the horsemen already in play.  
> What if the rapture's entirely manmade?  
>
> *[chorus]*  
> Whose flag will unfurl? Who'll bang the last girl?  
> Who'll kick the best ass at the end of the world?  
> Who'll watch the last dawn? Who'll sing the last song?  
> Who'll raise the last glass at the end of the world?  
>
> What if the trouble came straight to your door?  
> What if your table knew plenty no more?  
> With whom would you share and from whom would you hoard?  
> What if the trouble came straight to your door?  
>
> What if this planet is all that we get?  
> What if we ruin her and nothing comes next?  
> What would we remember what would we regret?  
> What if this planet is all that we get?  
>
> *[chorus]*
>
> What would he think about who we've become?  
> Our slavery to power and money and guns?  
> And hatred of strangers passed father to son?  
> What would he think about who we've become?  
>
> I think if Jesus comes back he'd be shaking his head.  
> As we searched for the missing and count all our dead.  
> He'd say, "Dead you aren't dead, didn't you hear what I said?"  
> I think if Jesus comes back he'd be shaking his head.  
>
> *[chorus]*

(I did this just by ear--it's not definite. The [whole album][rf] is
excellent.)
