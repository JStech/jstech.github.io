title: IdeaVIM in Android Studio

Android Studio is great. So is vim. I've figured out how to get the best of
both worlds, and it's pretty easy, thanks to [IdeaVIM][iv].

1. Go to the Android Studio preferences.
1. Choose "Plugins" from the left pane.
1. Click "Browse repositories..." at the bottom.
1. Search for IdeaVIM.
1. Click "Install plugin".
1. Restart.
