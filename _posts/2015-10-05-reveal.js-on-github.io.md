I gave a presentation a couple weeks ago, and wanted to host it online to avoid
any fumbling with video cables and thumbdrives: as long as there was a computer
connected to the projector and to the internet, just a few keystrokes would be
necessary to get started.

I found [reveal.js][rvl] and it looked pretty snazzy. Also, it had already been
[integrated with Jekyll][rjk]. However, that implementation was built to create
one site hosting one presentation, and I didn't want to replace this site with a
presentation. I figured there would be a way to adapt the code to let me host
presentations within the site, but I didn't have time to figure that out at the
time.

Fast forward, and I had the time to figure it out. I want to make some
improvements and package it up nicely, but for now, you can see the important
modifications [in these][gh1] [commits][gh2].
