<p>17 Sep 08, Bethesda, MD

<p>My first day was very successful! The 52.5 miles from home to my sister's in
Bethesda was no harder than it has been in the past, and this was probably the
heaviest bike (with gear) I've ever ridden. The weather was beautiful and there
were lots of people out biking. One guy saw my loaded bike & yelled after me,
"Business? Travel?" I yelled back, "San Diego" before he was too far behind me.
But a block later, he caught up with me--having turned around to chase me. He
asked if I was going to or coming from San Diego. "Going to--that's the plan,"
I replied. Then I added, "I left Baltimore today."

<p>I was trying to make a light, but I should've stopped to talk to him. Those
are the people I'd like to meet on this trip, and I was in no rush. I got to my
sister's before she got home from work, so I wouldn't have lost anything by
hanging back to chat.

<p>On the <a href="http://www.bikewashington.org/canal">canal</a> & <a
href="http://www.atatrail.org/">GAP</a> in the coming days I should run into a
lot of people--I'm going to make a point of not being too rushed--or not being
rushed at all, for that matter.
