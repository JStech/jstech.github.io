<p>18 Sep 08, Harper's Ferry, MD

<p>Day 2 was people day. Boring things: falling off bike, losing gloves, buying
new gloves, riding to my goal destination. Not boring things: chatting with a
triathlete about riding the <a
href="http://www.bikewashington.org/canal">C&O</a> and <a
href="http://www.atatrail.org">GAP</a>--and <a
href="http://www.ridetherockies.com">Ride The Rockies</a>--talking with a canal
bike patrol volunteer on the Monocacy Aqueduct, and sharing a campsite with
four very friendly riders--David, Jim, Carl and Jack--and a group of seven
BCPSS students with two of their teachers. The students attend the <a
href="http://www.independenceschool.org">Independence School</a> and go on
outdoors trips as part of their curriculum.

<p>The four other riders were the nicest guys. When I rode into camp, they were
interested in my bike, and were asking me all about it. In looking over the
bike, Jim noticed that I had some loose screws on my rack. He proceeded to open
his toolkit & go to town ensuring that all my important bolts were tight, and
straightening my rear rack.

<p>I definitely did a good job slowing down & talking to people today. I think
it's the best way to travel.
