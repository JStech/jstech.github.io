Viaduct</a>, Meyersdale, PA

<p>It was a four-tunnel, two-state, and sixty-six mile day. I finished the <a
href="http://www.bikewashington.org/canal">C&O</a>, stopped in Cumberland for
lunch and to pick up some supplies, and rode the first 30ish miles of the <a
href="http://www.atatrail.org">GAP</a>. As I neared Cumberland, I passed two
cyclists--obviously tourers by their loads--going the other direction. They had
stopped & I was moving slowly enough that I had time to ask them how far they
were going. Quickly I learned it was not how far they were going, but how far
they had come. They said they started at Lake Huron. THat was enough for me to
stop and chat. They had ridden <a
href="http://www.adventurecycling.org">Adventure Cycling</a>'s Great Lakes
route*, then the <a
href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/ugrr-pittsburgh-spur/">Pittsburgh
spur</a> of the <a
href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/underground-railroad-ugrr/">UGRR
route</a>, then the GAP to Cumberland. I told them of my plans and I discovered that they had ridden the segment of the <a href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/southern-tier/">Southern Tier</a> that I plan to ride, so we exchanged contact info, and I'll pester them with questions later via email.

<p>As people see me riding along, fully loaded, they often ask if I'm "doing the whole trail." My newest response is "And then some!" Fun. :-)
