<p>24 Sep 08, Zanesville, OH

<p>Today was my hardest day of cycling yet. The hills of eastern Ohio were
killer, and I didn't have a low enough gear to conquer them comfortably.

<p>There was some other excitement today&mdash;I started the day by getting
pulled over by the highway patrol for riding on a section of Rt 22 that is
closed to bikes (or attempting to&mdash;I had barely made it down the on ramp
when he stopped me). He was nice, and helpful, and pointed out that 22A
paralleled 22 until I could get back on the main route (when it went from 65 to
55). While this meant more hills, I did avoid a lot of traffic. (Although I'm
not certain that a 45 mph two-lane road with little or no shoulders is safer
than a 65 mph divided 4-lane highway with huge shoulders.)

<p>After the worst of the hills were over, I stopped for a late lunch in
Cambridge, OH. As I headed through town afterwards I saw another loaded cyclist
going east.  I crossed the street to chat with him&mdash;his name was Zach and
he was in the final leg of a cross-country tour that had started on July 17th
in Portland. He was returning to his home in McLean VA via Rt 40 and the <a
href="http://www.bikewashington.org/canal">C&O</a>. He was traveling
impressively light&mdash;just two rear panniers with a bag on top (counting his
tent & skateboard, he informed me). We chatted for awhile, admired each other's
bikes (at least, I thought his geared rear hub was really cool, and he
commented that he likes the <a
href="http://surlybikes.com/bikes/long_haul_trucker">LHT</a>), and went on our
ways. He's the first cross-country tourist I've bet on this trip, and the
second soloist, I think.

<p>Only other interesting thing today is that I'm camping in a cemetery. It's
something that I know cycle tourists do, but I hadn't tried yet. We'll see how
it goes. I've also got my tent on the ground for the first time*, and while
it's cramped, I at least don't have to deal with all my stuff sliding under me.

<p>Anyway, I've got only 65 miles to C-bus (I covered ~80mi today, despite
those hills!), and I'm going to try for a very early start so that I can avoid
riding thru downtown in rush hour traffic. So it's bedtime for me.

<p><i>* My tent is a hammock tent, so it's usually suspended between trees, or
whatever I can find to tie it to.</i>
