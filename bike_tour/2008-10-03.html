<p>3 Oct 08, near Cedarville, OH

<p>Getting back on the bike after a week's rest at home was less comfortable
than I had anticipated. I've got more pain in my knees, butt, elbows, and, most
oddly, leg muscles, than I ever had on my way between BAL & CMH. (With the
exception of my knees on 9/25 after way too much hard climbing on 9/24.) My new
gears are nice & low, but they're not as nice & smooth as the old set. They're
also definitely spread out more. I went from a 12-25 10-speed cassette to an
11-34 9-speed, so I've got a slightly higher high gear in addition to my much
lower low gear, and with fewer steps in between. It's worth it, though.

<p>Didn't meet anyone today, although the <a
href="http://www.ohiotoerietrail.org/">Ohio to Erie Trail</a> is very nice
(paved!). Not many people were out today&mdash;but tomorrow is Sat., so that
should make it more busy.
