<p>6 Oct 08, Kentucky

<p>Kentucky is beautiful, hilly, & friendly country.

<p>Met three different people today. First was Dooley, who pulled up behind me
on his bike when I had stopped to read my map & take a picture. I had a
motorcyclist pull up next to me & ask about my trip&mdash;apparently he had
done the same sort of thing for some time. Then, at the end of my day I stopped
& asked a guy if I could camp in his yard. We got to talking and it turns out
that Mark (& his brother) had ridden their bicycles from Lake Erie to Key West
in the recent past. He had lots of questions for me, and was very generous &
hospitable.
