<p>7 Oct 08, Clifty Falls State Park, Madison, IN

<p>I knew my perfect weather couldn't last. This afternoon&mdash;as I raced to
reach a bridge across the Ohio before rush hour&mdash;I first hit headwinds,
then rain. I was riding in what could be described as miserable
conditions&mdash;narrow, busy road, headwinds, rain, poor visibility&mdash;but
I wasn't deterred, and I was far from miserable. I reached the bridge right at
5 o'clock, and started over in what appeared to be a nice gap in traffic. Of
course, not much later I had a semi behind me. It ended up being fine&mdash;he
gave me space, and he was going pretty slowly himself up the first half of the
bridge. I went into a full sprint, nonetheless, and when I got down to the
other side&mdash;and Indiana&mdash;I pulled into a parking lot to catch my
breath & eat & drink. In Madison, IN, I was disappointed to find that most of
the interesting family restaurants along the main street were only open for
lunch. I did find a bar/grill type place with local art on the walls & a good
selection of music called Joeyg's. I had a cheeseburger & a beer and it was
superb&mdash;of course, my condition might have biased me. After I left, and
set to race the sunset to a campground, I knew I had a big climb to expect.
It's funny, though, because the hills seem to be gettingg smaller. Granted,
this one might not have been as steep, but I got to the top thinking I hadn't
really started the bulk of the climb yet. Talk about a pleasant surprise. Now
I'm camping in Clifty State Park, which is beautiful. 

<p>Awoken at 10:30 & told to move.
