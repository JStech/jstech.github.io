<p>11 Oct 2008, Henderson, KY

<p>A few rules for a successful bike tour:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink before you're thirsty
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eat before you're hungry
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop riding before you sleep
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't stop riding until long after you're tired

<p>Today was pleasant. I breakfasted with the XC team, then took off for
Owensboro. The riding was Ohio-flat with an intermittent tailwind, so I got a
lot of miles in.

<p>After lunch I passed two riders who were going the other direction on the
same route. Their names were Peter and Diana. We chatted briefly&mdash;mainly
about our route plans & how few other touring cyclists we'd seen. I realized
that the one thing we didn't discuss, which has been a part of virtually every
other conversation I've had recently, was the question, "Why are you doing
this?"

<p>I guess if you know, you know.
