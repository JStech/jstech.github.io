<p>15 Oct 2008, Stewart, TN

<p>I had some adventure today. The road I had planned to ride out of my
campsite was washed out & under construction. There wasn't an obvious detour,
so I invented one. (Well, some of it looked like it had been traveled
previously, but only by foot, I'm sure.) I rode along the side of (and through)
a soybean field, followed a power line cut to another field, and finally pushed
my bike through the woods & up a hill to return to the road. It was tough, and
my legs got really scraped up, but I think it was worth it, compared to
backtracking.

<p>Tonight I'm camping near a beautiful creek&mdash;I can hear it from my tent.
I was passed by some kids on ATVs and then saw them down by the creek when I
crossed the bridge. I decided to turn back and ask them about a campsite, and
they recommended I just go a little ways down the creek, which is what I did.
They were friendly & curious about my trip, so we chatted a bit before they
rode off & I made camp.
