<p>21 Oct 2008, Brandon, MS

<p>Another uneventful day. I got a slightly faster start than yesterday. While
heating up my breakfast my fuel ran out, and my food was also running low. I
was in Kosciusko, a town of about 7,000, so I could go to the grocery before I
started out for the day, or I could wait for evening when I'd be in the Jackson
area. Since I had enough to eat for lunch, and I knew I'd have to get fuel in
Jackson anyway I decided to wait. That turned out to be a wise choice, because
my campsite tonight is across the street from a Kroger, so I went over &
stocked up big time. I've also found a store that carries my fuel, and I'll
swing by there tomorrow. I also stopped for BBQ on my way in here. Mmm . . .
