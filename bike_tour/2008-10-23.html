<p>23 Oct 2008, Natchez, MS

<p>Mole Day made up for the past few quiet days on the Trace. I had planned to
get up early &amp; get a lot of miles in. But I woke up in the middle of the
night to the sound of rain, so I figured it wasn't worth the rush. As I did
(slowly) pack up, a guy came by walking his dog &amp; invited me to stop by his
camper (once he moved it) to warm up, so once I had most of my gear ready to
go, I headed over. He introduced himself as Lon, and proceeded to make me
(&amp; himself bacon, eggs &amp; toast for breakfast. He lives out of his
camper&mdash;at a private campground he's set up near Dallas during the winter
&amp; wherever during the summer&mdash;and he had tons of stories about how
hospitable &amp; kind people were (&amp; are) to him in his travels. Of course,
he was doing the same for me.

<p>I headed off on my bike at 11:30&mdash;very late, but I figured I'd just
ride the ~45 miles to Natchez State Park. Of course, after a long lunch stop
(Subway had the heat turned <u>way</u> up :-)) &amp; some time spent perusing
the NT stops &amp; sites, I found myself racing the sun to get to the
campground before dark.

<p>Then I came upon Eric. Eric is hiking the entire Trace, having started 3
months ago. I slowed down to talk with him a while (1.5 miles) &amp; we swapped
stories about our respective adventures. He's been stealth camping &amp; has
only slept under a roof once in all this time. With only one or two days left
until Natchez, I wished him luck as he finished his journey (he was either
going to buy a canoe &amp; row back to New Orleans or take a bus) &amp; started
pounding on to make it to the park before it was completely dark.

<p>It was pretty dark as I pulled in &amp; I had to make a turn to go towards
Campground B or go straight for Campground A. I opted for B, with a little
Robert Frost in mind, and it was a good choice. I thought I saw a campground
sign as I pulled in, but decided it was time to pull out the headlamp to make
sure. As I was doing that, someone walked up (I just saw his headlamp coming
towards me) &amp; greeted me. He asked if I was touring; I said yes &amp; he
replied, "We are too."

<p>"We" it turned out was Ben &amp; Meg. They're from Philly, but have been
touring down south for a few weeks. They started from Chattanooga (IIRC) &amp;
were heading for New Orleans. They invited me to join them for dinner, so they
fed me too!

<p>Anyway, it's been an eventful, long, short-day &amp; we're planning to ride
into Natchez first thing in the morning, so I've got to sleep.
