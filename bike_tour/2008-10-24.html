<p>24 Oct 2008, Centreville, MS

<p>Wow, another day full of generosity. I rode to Natchez with Ben &amp; Meg.
We got breakfast, then went to the river front, where I got my first (ever?)
view of the Mississippi . . . bathed in fog. It was like looking at a white
wall. Oh well&mdash;tomorrow I'll cross it on a ferry, and it should be totally
clear.

<p>I left Ben &amp; Meg's company &amp; rode SE out of town. As I rode, I came
across a yard/field full of goats. One billy had horns that were at least 18"
long (each). I stopped to take a picture, &amp; a woman came out of the house,
calling to me, "You like our goats?" When I told her that I was particularly
impressed by the one billy's horns, she told me that when he died I could have
them. Apparently he was over 50 years old. I left her my address &amp; she gave
me a deer's antler as a souvenir &amp; made me promise I'd keep it, so I
strapped it to my bag &amp; thought about where else &amp; how else I could
attach it&mdash;it might have to go on my helmet, <a

<p>Around 4:30 I rolled into Centreville, MS, needing to refill my water &amp;
use the bathroom. I was heading into the bank when a woman coming the other way
saw me &amp; asked if I had been traveling a long way. It didn't take long to
learn her name&mdash;Judi&mdash;and for her to offer me their travel trailer
for the night. So I'm here, after two meals (my mac &amp; cheese, and the chili
&amp; veggies that Judi &amp; Tom made), lots of good conversation &amp;
finally a hot shower. Anyway, I've got to sleep soon, because I'm joining Judi
&amp; Tom in helping at their church's food pantry in the morning. I've been
the recipient of so much kind generosity from strangers.
