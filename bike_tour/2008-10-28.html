<p>28 Oct 2008, Merryville, LA

<p>Another pretty mundane day. I did have my second flat, though. I'm camping
at the Merryville Historical Society &amp; Museum, which opens its doors to
cyclists traveling through the area. The MHS secretary, Linda, met me here
&amp; gave me the full tour. She was obviously proud of the artifacts &amp; the
work done to collect &amp; restore them. I wouldn't say she did the best job of
making it all interesting&mdash;her comments were either stating the obvious
("These are military uniforms") or irrelevant minutae (who donated the old
clarinet for the high school band showcase).

<p>Anyway, a hot shower is, as always, appreciated. I'm walking over to the
post office to mail a postcard &amp; see if I can get enough reception to call
home.
