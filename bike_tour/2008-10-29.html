<p>Oct 2008, Kountze, TX

<p>I rode a lot of miles today&mdash;over 81.5. Didn't see any other cyclists,
though. I'm camping in the yard of a very friendly man named Tony. He and his
son were out clearing trees downed by the recent hurricane (although I don't
think his son, age 4, was helping much). He offered me some MREs, which were
left over from the hurricane relief efforts. I took three, &amp; we'll see how
they turn out.

<p>That brings up the subject of food. I've had some very good local cuisine in
recent days. There was the jambalaya that Joey cooked &amp; gave me&mdash;lots
of meat, lots of spices, lots of rice&mdash;very tasty. Then last night I tried
boudin, another Cajun specialty. Boudin is kind of like jambalaya in a sausage
casing. The one I had was more rice than meat, though, &amp; I think jambalaya
is often closer to 1/2 &amp; 1/2. Then today I stopped for some Texas BBQ (I
rode into Texas around 9:30 this morning). The sandwich didn't have a typical
BBQ flavor&mdash;like what you get from BBQ sauce&mdash;but it was <u>sooo</u>
good. The meat was very juicy &amp; flavorful. I'm looking forward to eating my
way across Texas.
