<p>Nov 2008, Smithville, TX

<p>Slow getting out of camp today. That site just had too much
wildlife&mdash;raccoons got into my stuff in the night. They only took my
bagels &amp; stuff from the trash, but I had to get up &amp; hang my stuff from
the awning in the middle of the night. Bleh.

<p>After only five miles I ran into a large group of cyclists&mdash;they were
actually a few different groups. They were all out just for a day ride, but two
were going the same way I was, so they rode along with me for a few miles.
Their names were Matt &amp; Gary and they were very interested in my trip &amp;
had a good tip&mdash;there is a website called warm showers.org where people
can find cyclist-friendly stops while touring. I definitely need to check it
out.

<p>I stopped for lunch in Round Top, TX, which was having a wine festival. I
joined a table of locals who were interested in my trip. One of them was the
chef &amp; he had some superb gumbo. It was excellent &amp; he gave me a free
refill.

<p>I pulled into camp to find it packed. This time it was a martial arts group.
I picked out a spot &amp; introduced myself to the folks next door&mdash;five
people not in the martial arts group who seemed about my age. They offered me a
sausage &amp; we sat &amp; talked for a while.

<p>Anyway, I'm quite exhausted, and even though the clocks fall back tonight,
the sun will still rise nice &amp; early, so I've got to sleep.
