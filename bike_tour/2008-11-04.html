<p>4 Nov 2008, Wimberley, TX

<p>I left Austin today around noon&mdash;which was pretty slow. I mailed my old
sleeping bag &amp; pad, etc. home on my way out, so between Sebastian's and the
post office I must have been quite the sight, with stuff piled high on my rack.

<p>Tonight I'm camping near Wimberley, TX, in the back yard of John &amp;
Dorothy Threeton. They're a very nice couple&mdash;very active &amp;
fun-loving. They fed me dinner &amp; have promised me breakfast as well. They
even offered a shower &amp; a bed, but I passed, after having such amenities
for two days in Austin.

<p>I've taken some time to make a lot of much-needed phone calls tonight, but
it's cut into my journal and Bible time, so I'm going to say goodnight here.
