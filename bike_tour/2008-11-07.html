<p>7 Nov 2008, Montell, TX

<p>What a day. As I rolled out of camp this AM my back wheel was feeling
flat&mdash;I could feel every little rock &amp; bump. I checked it as I got up
to the road, and it certainly was flat. While changing a tire isn't the most
pleasant way to start the day, I knew I was getting out early (it was ~8:15),
and that I had a short (but hilly) day. I actually got rolling around 9, and at
my first stop (a restroom break) I had two women ask me about my trip &amp;
talk for a bit about the area &amp; terrain.

<p>The terrain was noteworthy because of three major climbs, each a good 500',
up winding roads with beautiful scenery on the way. The descents were fun, of
course &amp; I was reminded of Brazil tour, when we drove through the
mountains.

<p>I lunched in Leakey &amp; stopped into the library to email Mom &amp; Dad,
since I had no cell reception. A nice couple who were working there told me
about hosting a group of cyclists who came through at some point. They were
very friendly &amp; the man gave me his card before I left.

<p>My stop tonight was arranged through <a
href="http://www.warmshowers.org">warmshowers.org</a>. I'm staying with Alice,
who has been a generous hostess along with her boyfriend Andre. I did laundry
&amp; got a shower &amp; a hot meal, so I'm pretty happy. Tomorrow I'm staying
with another warmshowers.org user, and Alice says she's got family &amp;
friends spread between here &amp; El Paso to keep me covered.
