<p>8 Nov 2008, Del Rio, TX

<p>I left Alice's house clean &amp; well-fed this morning. I could tell,
though, that my rear tire was low. Since it wasn't totally flat I just pumped
it up &amp; kept riding. I've been in ranch country for a while and I've
decided that if I ever have the opportunity to name a ranch, it will be the
Lazy Icosahedron &pi; Ranch&mdash;my geeky play on the Lazy-shape-letter form
of most ranch names.

<p>The terrain today was pretty flat, and I pulled into Brackettville for lunch
after covering 40 miles without really thinking about it. I left (after having
a pretty typical conversation with two motorcyclists: How far each day? and
why?) and quickly realized my rear tire was low again. I tried to just top it
off, but it quickly was flat, so I finally changed it.

<p>As I headed for Del Rio on US 90, there was a hunter unloading his truck
just behind the fence along the road. He asked me something but I had trouble
hearing him so I slowed down &amp; then stopped. He came through the gate &amp;
we talked for a few minutes. He was decked out in camp &amp; carrying two
rifles (a small one for "varmints" &amp; the serious one for deer). We spent a
few minutes mutually curious &amp; a bit befuddled by the other's pastime
before we parted ways.

<p>I got into Del Rio a bit later than planned &amp; met James, my host via <a
href="http://www.warmshowers.org">warmshowers.org</a>. He was generous &amp;
made me feel right at home. He had to run off to a political celebration, so I
set to investigating my rear tire. After fixing some poor patching, deciding to
swap the front &amp; back tires, pausing for some dinner, and breaking the
valve on a tube &amp; therefore changing it again, James came back &amp;
convinced me to go get a drink with him &amp; his friends. Turned out to be the
right idea&mdash;his friends were fun &amp; interesting people, mostly lawyers
&amp; political types, who had for various reasons found their way (back) to
Del Rio. Dan &amp; Courtney from Boston wanted to get out of N.E. &amp; came to
TX for a public defendant non-profit of some sort. Janae traveled Europe &amp;
Africa for 4 months after flying over on a one-way ticket, now applying for the
Foreign Service. Cool people.
