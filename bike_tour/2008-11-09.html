<p>9 Nov 2008, Seminole Canyon State Park, Comstock, TX

<p>Doing this quickly tonight&mdash;I'm tired. Went to Mass w/James. They had
out-of-town guests introduce themselves &amp; say where they're from. The
priest added that I'd biked there &amp; was on my way to S.D. (because I'd met
him the previous night at the restaurant where we met up with James's
friends&mdash;Del Rio doesn't have the biggest nightlife scene, I guess). The
congregation gave me a round of applause. (Awkward.)

<p>Slow/late start because of Mass, phone calls &amp; forgetting my pen. I had
some pretty awesome tailwinds all afternoon, though, so I was cruising pretty
well. Of course, the wind makes my rainfly into a thunder machine, so I'm going
without for now&mdash;we'll see if it rains.

<p>Passed through an immigration checkpoint. The guard apparently wasn't too
worried about me&mdash;he asked me if I was a US citizen, then just asked about
the trip.

<p>Camping in Seminole Canyon State Historical Park. No trees here, so I'm
sleeping above the picnic table, hanging from the corners of the trellis over
the table.

<p>Oiled my pump &amp; fixed a flat (once &amp; for all?) tonight.
