<p>11 Nov 2008, Marathon, TX

<p>Long day today&mdash;75 miles. I had planned to get up at 5:30 &amp; be on
the road by 7. Of course that didn't happen. I was hearing different insects
&amp; noises &amp; in my early morning stupor convinced myself that one of the
noises was a rattlesnake &amp; I'd be better off staying in bed. So I got up at
6:45 &amp; got riding at 8. I had headwinds all day &amp; a flat tire so it
wasn't until just after dark that I finished up.

<p>I met one guy today who pulled over &amp; hopped out of his truck to talk to
me. His name is John &amp; he's some kind of USAF flight demo team pilot. He
said he always tries to talk to cycle tourists as they come through.

<p>Tonight I'm staying in Marathon, TX in a papercrete building that is part of
what's basically a hippie compound, so far as I can tell. I made this
connection through warmshowers.org &amp;  my host, Stan, did a tour of his own
before deciding he'd spend some time here in Marathon helping out &amp;
providing some skilled labor.
