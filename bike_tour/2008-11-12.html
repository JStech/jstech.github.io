<p>12 Nov 2008, Alpine, TX

<p>Short ride today, only about 30 miles. I took my time getting moving in the
morning. I was given a full tour of La Loma Del Chivo&mdash;it was very
interesting to see how papercrete is made &amp; how it's used in construction.
I'm not sold that it's necessarily a wunderkind of a material&mdash;it isn't as
strong as concrete, but it's cheap &amp; is a very good insulator. the whole
stop just got me thinking off the grid thoughts.

<p>Anyway, I left Marathon after lunch &amp; rode all afternoon with a DQ stop
right as I got into Alpine. I stopped at the bike shop right as it was closing
&amp; picked up new tubes (which are thorn-resistant &amp; ultra thick) &amp; a
new rear blink (really I just needed the mount because mine broke). Then I
found the house I'm staying at (Liz Rogers, sister of Alice in Montell) and let
myself in. Liz is out of town on work, but let me stay here nonetheless. So
I've showered, done laundry, switched to the new tubes, eaten, called home
&amp; Kim, &amp; gotten a lot of computer stuff taken care of. So it's been a
productive stop. Now I'm hitting the sack, &amp; tomorrow I head for Marfa.
