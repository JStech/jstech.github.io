<p>15 Nov 2008, Van Horn, TX

<p>Last night was cold. I had a partly-frozen water bottle this morning &amp;
when I went to make cereal the water froze across the surface. The cold slowed
my start&mdash;I climbed back into my warm sleeping bag twice. The late start
didn't slow me down too much, though&mdash;I still made it 75 miles to Van
Horn, which is where I was heading for. Riding on I-10 shoulder was not all
that different than many other roads in TX, especially east TX where there was
more traffic. 

<p>Paralleling the trains is fun&mdash;they definitely go faster, but not
always by much, so it feels like a race.

<p>In a motel tonight&mdash;it was only a few bucks more expensive than
camping, &amp; I should be able to get an early start tomorrow. Of course, I
ended up wasting time watching <u>Die Another Day</u> on TV, which I'd never
seen before. So it's bedtime now.
