<p>17 Nov 2008, El Paso, TX

<p>I did not ride 90 miles today. I did ride about 50, and I rode through El
Paso, which is a bigger city than I had expected (1/2 million).

<p>I'm staying with a Warm Showers contact, Roy Vantine. He's retired military
&amp; he &amp; his wife are avid cyclists. Nice people, good food, the usual
stuff I guess.

<p>Today was very flat until I started out of El Paso. It was somewhat
unpleasant because I ended up on a busy street during rush hour (which begins
at 4 here). The mountains around El Paso are pretty, too.
