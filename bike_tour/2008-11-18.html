<p>18 Nov 2008, Caballo, NM

<p>It was pretty cold last night, so I'm writing this on the morning of the
19th.

<p>I may have ridden 100 mi today. I wasn't following the ACA route exactly
this morning, so I'll have to look at the GPS data to know for sure, but it was
definitely 90+ miles.

<p>My host, Roy, rode out with me this morning along with his friend George.
George is on the board of an insurance company in UA! Pretty amazing, being all
the way out here &amp; finding a UA connection. They rode with me for the first
15 or so miles&mdash;they're training for the Tour of Tucson this weekend.

<p>The rest of the day was very flat with a tailwind, so I was cruising around
15 mph. The tailwind was probably &lt;10mph, but it was strong enough to help.
So now I'm within 40 miles of the peak of Emory Pass, so I called Pat &amp;
told her to expect me a day early.

<p>Excellent enchiladas in Las Cruces. They were out of chile rellenos, though
:-(.

<p>The stars out here are incredible.
