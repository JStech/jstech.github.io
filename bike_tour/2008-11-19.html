<p>19 Nov 2008, Hanover, NM

<p>I climbed a mountain today! Emory pass, at 8,228 ft, is the highest point on
this trip. It was about 4000' higher than where I started this AM. It wasn't
particularly steep, but it was just a long time chugging up the hill. I left
just before 9am, &amp; I reached the top of the pass about 3:45pm&mdash;only 38
miles later. The downhill was a treat, of course, except that it also had some
uphill sections.

<p>As I ate lunch in Hillsboro, NM, a man came up &amp; we started talking. He
was working to write a book of his (recently deceased) grandmother's life
store. He was a nice guy &amp; had some insight into local history that he
shared.

<p>My host tonight is Pat, who I found through Warm Showers. She keeps a
scrapbook of all the cyclist who've come through, and she can tell stories
about each of them. She also fed me well &amp; set me up with some cookies to
take along on my trip.

<p>Tomorrow is the Gila Cliff Dwellings. Should be pretty cool.
