<p>21 Nov 2008, Silver City, NM

<p>Today I climbed all day. At least that's how it felt. The climb out of the
Gila River Valley was probably the hardest climb of the trip. At the top I
stopped at the overlook for a minute &amp; met a nice British couple who were
traveling through the West in a rental RV. We saw a bald eagle &amp; ironically
they had to identify it for me. The afternoon climb was easier, but I was
pretty sick of climbing at that point.

<p>I did enjoy a geothermal shower this AM &amp; I met Dave (who told me about
the shower) at lunch by coincidence. He &amp; his wife Bobbi are from Colorado
&amp; volunteer at the Cliff Dwellings. They were good company at
lunch&mdash;along with another volunteer.

<p>Staying in a hotel tonight. Warm Showers didn't work out for me, but I
wanted a warm bed &amp; laundry, so I'm doing it the expensive way. I got calls
from Grandmommmy and Granddaddy and Uncle Tom &amp; I talked to Kim awhile, so
that was nice.
