<p>22 Nov 2008, Apache National Forest, AZ

<p>Nothing much exciting today. I cruised out of Silver City after a few wrong
turns to make a short 4-mile assault on the continental divide&mdash;my third
crossing in as many days (&amp; my last). Then I had a nice long gradual
descent for the rest of the morning.

<p>As I was nearing my campsite for the evening, I passed through Mule Creek, a
tiny town just 5 miles from the AZ border. It's really just a post
office&mdash;and a small one at that, probably &lt;500 sq. ft.&mdash;but there
were three people standing outside chatting. I asked if there was somewhere
nearby to fill my water bottles &amp; I ended up riding to one of their houses.
The woman was very kind&mdash;she sat at the gate in her car until I caught up,
then offered me a ride back to the house (along a bumpy dirt road, so I was
happy to accept). Her house was beautifully decorated &amp; very
earthy&mdash;lots of wood &amp; brick. Made me again think that I want a place
"in the country" someday. A ranch would be nice . . .

<p>I made it to Arizona&mdash;my twelfth &amp; penultimate state&mdash;and I'm
camping in the Apache National Forest. It's a nice campsite (although no water)
&amp; I've got it all to myself!

<p>It's feeling like it won't be as cold here tonight as my past few nights. If
I can get an early start tomorrow I might go for another 100+ mile
day&mdash;I've got a lot of descent coming up...we'll see.
