<p>23 Nov 2008, Fort Thomas, AZ

<p>Wheeee!!! Today I am camping about 3000' lower than last night&mdash;that
means I had a lot of downhill. The first descent&mdash;into Three Way, AZ, was
the most fun. Tight, winding switchbacks &amp; some incredible vistas made it a
challenge to see everything&mdash;I wanted to look at the scenery, but needed
to watch the road at the same time.

<p>I didn't get the massive mileage I had hoped for because it was <u>cold</u>
this morning, so despite waking before dawn, I only started riding at 8, and
was going pretty slow even then. Tonight is already much warmer than this time
last night, so hopefully I can get an early start tomorrow.

<p>I did a good job of keeping my speed&mdash;and cadence&mdash;up during the
short climb after Three Way &amp; then also after the road flattened out going
into Safford. I think it helps to have an upbeat song in your head ("Two Step"
&amp; "3x5" today).

<p>Tonight I'm camping at the memorial for the founder of the Lions Clubs. Dad
got a kick out of that &amp; asked me to take a photo. It's a nice park with a
monument. There are two members' phone numbers listed in the information box,
so I called up &amp; asked if I could camp. "Of course," was basically the
answer. Nice people...
