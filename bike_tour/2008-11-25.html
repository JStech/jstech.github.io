<p>25 Nov 2008, Scottsdale, AZ

<p>Today was a day of frustrating flats. I lost track of how many times I
changed my front tire but I managed to blow all my tubes &amp; use all my
patches. For some reason they just don't seem to work on the thorn-resistant
tubes. They blister up &amp; peel off. I limped into Scottsdale on a slow leak
&amp; headed for a bike shop. When I was about 6 blocks away the tire just went
out completely, so I took all the bags off the front &amp; walked the rest of
the way to the shop, <a

Showcase</a>.

<p>The owner (or manager?) took good care of me&mdash;he'd done his own cross
country tour this past summer (including the GAP &amp; C&amp;O) and he was
jealous of my trip. "All I want to worry about is where I'm going to sleep
tonight," he told me. He gave me a pair of just-barely-used tires for $15.

<p>That got me to the Gallants' &amp; now I can relax for a few days.
