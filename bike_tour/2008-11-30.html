<p>30 Nov 2008, Salome, AZ

<p>I was just in a daze most of the day. I had a flat before I even left, so I
patched it (&amp; swapped the front &amp; back tubes). Then I got another flat
after only 1/2 hr. Thankfully that seemed to be it for now, and I had no more
trouble after that.

<p>I stopped pretty early b/c there is a 30 mile gap between campgrounds. Ended
up being a good thing, because I'm not the only cyclist here tonight! Two
couples&mdash;Barbara &amp; Michael from Boulder &amp; Gabi &amp; Christian
from Bavaria&mdash;were already here, so I got to meet them &amp; hear about
all their travels. They're riding east, so they also had some tips for me about
campsites to avoid (&amp; about good ones too). Michael is another
former-engineer-turned-business-consultant, so it was fun to hear about his
career path. Gabi &amp; Christian are German and so of course there was
interesting cultural exchange there.

<p>Tomorrow I'm hoping to ride 78 miles, so I'm going to hit the sack.
