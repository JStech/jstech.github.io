<p>3 Dec 2008, Ocotillo, CA

<p>Today I crossed the Imperial Valley. It is large, flat, below sea level,
full of industrial farms, and quite smelly in places.

<p>Two cyclists overtook me near Imperial. They were riding fixes. The guy
asked me about my trip&mdash;he and his brother have apparently kicked around
the idea of a cross country tour. I gave the AC maps high praise.

<p>I had lunch at a little hole-in-the-wall Mexican place near the El Centro
Naval Air Facility. They had a personalized signed photo of the Blue Angels on
the wall &amp; there were some F-18 pilots having lunch there (one had a patch
on his shoulder that said "1000 hours F-18").

<p>Camping tonight at an RV park. Actually, I'll be sleeping in the rec room.
Nice people, free, clean shower, laundry, altogether a good stop.
