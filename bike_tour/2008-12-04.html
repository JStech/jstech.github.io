<p>4 Dec 2008, Alpine, CA

<p>Lots of up &amp; down today as I cross the last mountains along the shore.
I'm about 40 miles from the water tonight! Of course, my plan isn't to get
there tomorrow&mdash;I'm going to go to Kim's 2nd cousin's in south east San
Diego, Andrea's. Saturday I'll hit the coast.

<p>Met &amp; talked with a lot of cool people today. First was a woman who had
pulled over on the long climb that started the day&mdash;I think her name is
Annie . . . I've got her card somewhere. She's another former
engineer&mdash;now she makes &amp; sells jewelry. We talked some politics
(she's a big Obama fan) &amp; she asked all about my trip before I headed off
again.

<p>The next group of people I met because I walked into the Jacumba library to
use a computer, and found them installing them. One woman was so excited about
my trip she had her picture taken with me. One of the guys had ridden the West
Coast previously &amp; walked out to check out my bike.

<p>Then at lunch (Lynda's Salsa in Boulevard&mdash;very good Mexican) the folks
at the next table asked me about the trip. They had seen my bike out front.

<p>I also got waved through a Border Patrol checkpoint (on an uphill) &amp; had
traffic stopped to let me through a short work zone with the road to myself.

<p>So yeah&mdash;good day.
