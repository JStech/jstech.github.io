<p>5 Dec 2008, Chula Vista, CA

<p>What a day! Severe winds kept me awake through the night, so I got something
of an early start. Met another touring cyclist along the way&mdash;Tony Morgan.
Nice guy, also rode the coast then decided to keep going in pieces.

<p>The route I (hastily) planned to Andrea's took me up a big hill, then
partway down to a dead end, which was frustrating. I backtracked, stopped in a
library &amp; planned a new route. Got here around 2 instead of, say, 11.

<p>Kim's relatives are all very nice&mdash;we drove to Temecula to join
Andrea's grandmother &amp; aunts &amp; uncle &amp; cousin. Got into a car
accident going to dinner&mdash;no one was hurt, but I guess that's just
California. Now I'm exhausted &amp; I hope to get at least halfway to the
Rowans' tomorrow.
