<p>6 Dec 2008, Encinitas, CA

<p>"Ocean in view! Overjoyed!" (or whatever the quote is from Lewis &amp;
Clark).

<p>I headed out at 10 this morning &amp; rode into SD, then started up the
coast! I haven't actually touched the water yet. I had a little trouble
navigating the north end of the S.D. Bay. I was trying to stay close to the
water &amp; keep it on my left, but that put me going south onto a submarine
base, so I had to backtrack a bit &amp; go inland. It is very beautiful here,
of course, and I appreciate having bike lanes just about everywhere.

<p>I rode ~50 miles today &amp; I have about the same tomorrow, then I'm done .
. . It doesn't seem remarkable, what I've done, even through so many people
seem to think so. I just committed myself to going out &amp; doing a little bit
more each day. It wasn't grueling or painful or arduous &amp; it wasn't
especially dangerous either. It just became route. Of course some parts were
never routine&mdash;finding a new place to sleep every night, interacting with
&amp; meeting brand new people every day.

<p>I've not had any strong feelings about finishing this trip &amp; I think
it's because I'm just exchanging one routine for another.

<p>Anyway, enough reflection, it's bedtime.

<p><i>The correct quote is, 'Ocian in view! O! The Joy!' &mdash;William Clark.
